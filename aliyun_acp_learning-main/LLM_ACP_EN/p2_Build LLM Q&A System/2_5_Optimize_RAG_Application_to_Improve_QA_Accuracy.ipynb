        "In the previous lessons, you have already identified some issues with the RAG chatbot through automated evaluations. However, optimizing prompts alone cannot fix problems caused by **inaccurate retrieval**, just as it would be difficult to provide the correct answer during an open-book exam if you were using the wrong reference material.\n",

        "In this section, you will gain a deeper understanding of the **RAG workflow** and work on improving the **accuracy of your RAG application’s question-answering**. This involves refining both the **retrieval** and **generation** phases to ensure that the model not only finds relevant information but also uses it effectively to produce accurate and reliable responses.\n",

        "### 4.1 Document preparation stage\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional customer service systems, customer service personnel accumulate a knowledge base based on the questions raised by users, and share it with other staff for reference. This process is equally essential when building a RAG chatbot.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Intent space**: We can map the needs behind user questions as points, which together form a user intent space.\n",
        "* **Knowledge space**: The knowledge points accumulated in the knowledge base documents constitute a knowledge space. These knowledge points can be a paragraph or a chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we project the intent space and knowledge space together, we find that there are overlaps and differences between the two spaces. These areas correspond to our three subsequent optimization strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overlapping area**:\n",
        "    * This refers to parts where user questions can be answered based on the content of the knowledge base, forming the foundation of ensuring the effectiveness of the RAG chatbot.\n",
        "    * For these user intents, you can continuously improve the quality of responses through optimizing content quality, engineering, and algorithms.\n",
        "2. **Uncovered intent space**:\n",
        "    * Due to the lack of supporting content in the knowledge base, LLMs tend to generate hallucinations. For example, if the company has added a new \"Data Analysis Department,\" but there are no related documents in the knowledge base, no matter how much you improve the engineering algorithms, the RAG chatbot will not be able to accurately answer this question.\n",
        "    * What you need to do is proactively supplement the missing knowledge, and continually track changes in the user intent space.\n",
        "3. **Unused knowledge space**:\n",
        "    * Recalling irrelevant information may interfere with the LLM's responses.\n",
        "    * Therefore, you need to optimize the recall algorithm to avoid recalling unrelated content. Additionally, you should periodically check the knowledge base and remove irrelevant content.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Before attempting to optimize engineering or algorithms, you should prioritize building a mechanism that continuously collects user intents. By systematically gathering real user needs to enrich the knowledge base content and involving domain experts with deep understanding of user intents in the evaluation process, a closed-loop optimization process of \"data collection - knowledge update - expert validation\" is formed to ensure the effectiveness of the RAG chatbot.\n",

        "In addition to rewriting a query for clarity, you can also break down complex questions into simpler, sequential steps. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries—such as identifying information about individuals with common names like \"Michael Johnson.\" By breaking down the original question, you enable the system to retrieve more comprehensive and accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "LlamaIndex offers two powerful tools that support this approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `StepDecomposeQueryTransform`: This tool helps break down a complex question into multiple sub-questions. It leverages an LLM to analyze the intent behind the query, and generate a series of logical follow-up questions that lead to the final answer. For the question *\"Which department does Michael Johnson belong to?\"*, the tool might break it down into:\n",
        "    - **Step 1:** *\"How many employees named Michael Johnson are there in the company?\"*\n",
        "    - **Step 2:** *\"Which departments do these Michael Johnsons belong to?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "By doing so, the system avoids missing relevant information due to ambiguity and ensures all possible matches are considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `MultiStepQueryEngine`: This query engine processes each of the sub-questions generated by `StepDecomposeQueryTransform` in sequence. After retrieving answers to each step, it combines the results into a single, coherent response.\n",
        "    - First, it retrieves all employees named Michael Johnson.\n",
        "    - Then, it queries the department information for each one.\n",
        "    - Finally, it compiles a response such as (just for illustrative purposes):\n",
        "        > *\"There are three Michael Johnsons in the company, working in the Teaching and Research Department, Course Development Department, and IT Department, respectively.\"*\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Improved Accuracy:** Breaking down queries leads to more thorough retrieval and reduces the risk of missing key details.\n",
        "- **Better Handling of Ambiguity:** Especially useful for queries involving common names or unclear references.\n",
        "- **Logical Flow:** Mimics how humans solve complex problems — by dividing them into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Considerations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Increased LLM Usage:** Since each step may involve calling an LLM, this method consumes more tokens than a single-query approach.\n",

        "Now, the LLM will generate the final answer based on your question and the retrieved content. However, this answer may still not meet your expectations. The issues you might encounter include:\n",
        "1. No relevant information was retrieved, causing the LLM to hallucinate an answer.\n",
        "2. Relevant information was retrieved, but the LLM did not generate the answer as required.\n",
        "3. Relevant information was retrieved, and the LLM provided an answer, but you expected the AI to give a more comprehensive response.\n",
        "To address these issues, you can analyze and resolve them from the following perspectives:\n",
        "* Choosing the right LLM:\n",
        "    * For simple information queries and summaries, a small-parameter model is sufficient, such as [qwen-turbo](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#ff492e2c10lub).\n",
        "    * If you want the Q&A bot to perform complex logical reasoning, it is recommended to choose a larger-parameter LLM with stronger reasoning capabilities, such as [qwen-plus](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#bb0ffee88bwnk) or even [Qwen-Max](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#cf6cc4aa2aokf).\n",
        "    * If your question requires reviewing a large number of document fragments, it is recommended to choose a model with a longer context length, such as [qwen-long](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#27b2b3a15d5c6), [qwen-turbo](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#ff492e2c10lub), or [qwen-plus](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#bb0ffee88bwnk).\n",
        "    * If the RAG chatbot you are building is for non-general domains such as the legal field, it is recommended to use a model trained specifically for that domain, such as [Tongyi Farei](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/models#f0436273ef1xm).\n",
        "* Fully optimize the prompt template. For example:\n",
        "    * Clearly request no fabrication of answers:\n",
        "        * LLMs may produce inaccurate content, a phenomenon commonly referred to as hallucination.\n",
        "        * You can reduce the likelihood of LLM hallucinations by requiring in the prompt: \"If the provided information is insufficient to answer the question, please explicitly state 'Based on the available information, I cannot answer this question.' Do not fabricate answers.\"\n",
        "    * Add content delimiters: \n",
        "        * If the retrieved document chunks are randomly mixed into the prompt, it will be difficult for humans to see the structure of the entire prompt, and the LLM will also be affected. \n",
        "        * It is recommended to clearly separate the prompt and the retrieved chunks so that the LLM can correctly understand your intent.\n",
        "    * Adjust the template according to the type of question: \n",
        "        * Different types of questions may require different response paradigms. You can use the LLM to identify the question type and then map different prompt templates accordingly. \n",
        "        * For example, for some questions, you may want the LLM to first output the overall framework and then the details; for other questions, you may prefer the LLM to provide concise conclusions.\n",
        "* Adjust the parameters of the LLM. For example:\n",
        "    * If you want the LLM to produce the same output for the same question, pass the same seed value each time the model is invoked.\n",
        "    * If you want to discourage the model from repeating tokens that have already appeared in the response, you can increase the presence_penalty value. \n",
        "    * If you are querying factual content, appropriately decrease the temperature or top_p values; conversely, when generating creative content,  increase their values.\n",
        "    * If you need to limit the word count (such as generating summaries or keywords), control costs, or reduce response time, appropriately lower the max_tokens value. However, if max_tokens is too low, it may lead to truncated output. Conversely, when generating long text, increase its value.\n",
        "    * Refer to the [Qwen API Reference](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/use-qwen-by-calling-api) to learn more about the usage instructions for various parameters."

        "Through this section, you have gained an understanding the workflow of a simple RAG and common optimization techniques. You can also combine the knowledge you've acquired with your specific needs to route certain questions to different RAG chatbots, thereby building a more powerful modular RAG system. Additionally, from the previous lessons, you should also recognize that LLMs are not only useful for building question-answering systems: Leveraging LLMs to identify user intent and extract structured information—such as extracting tags from user questions as mentioned earlier—can also be applied in many other application scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, the optimization methods for RAG go far beyond those introduced in this course. The industry continues to research and explore RAG, and there are still many advanced RAG topics worth  studying. As shown through the previous learning, building a well-rounded and high-performing RAG chatbot is no simple task. In real-world applications, you may need to act quickly and won’t always have time to dive into every detail. Below are some directions worth exploring:\n",
        "\n",
        "* GraphRAG ingeniously combines the strengths of RAG and query-focused summarization (QFS), providing a powerful solution for handling large-scale text data. It integrates the advantages of both technologies: RAG excels at finding precise detailed information, while QFS is better at understanding and summarizing the overall content of an article. This combination allows GraphRAG to accurately answer specific questions and handle complex queries that require deeper understanding, making it particularly suitable for building intelligent question-answering systems. If you want to learn how to  apply GraphRAG in practice, you can refer to the detailed tutorial provided by LlamaIndex: [Building a GraphRAG Application with LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v2/).\n",
        "* With Model Studio, you can follow the document [Build a Private Knowledge Question-Answering Application Without Coding](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/build-knowledge-base-qa-assistant-without-coding) to quickly build a fairly effective RAG chatbot.\n",
        "* If your business processes are more complex, you can also leverage Visual Workflow, an agent orchestration application on Model Studio to build a more powerful application.\n",
        "* Model Studio also offers a range of [LlamaIndex components](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/llamaindex/), allowing you to fully leverage Model Studio's capabilities while continuing to use the familiar LlamaIndex API to build RAG chatbots."
