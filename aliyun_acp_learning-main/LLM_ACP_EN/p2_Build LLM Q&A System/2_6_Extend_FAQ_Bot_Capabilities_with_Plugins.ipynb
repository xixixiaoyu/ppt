        "In the previous lessons, you have already learned about how to improve the performance of Q&A bots by optimizing prompts and retrieval processes. However, the current Q&A bot still has certain limitations. This section will guide you in identifying these shortcomings, and introduce the application of agents to address these issues. These agents are based on LLMs, and can extend their capabilities, akin to equipping a robot  with hands.\n",

        "* Familiarize yourself with the design and implementation of multi-agent systems\n",

        "\n",
        "“Those who cannot plan for the whole cannot manage a part.” In any complex task, defining objectives is the first step toward success. Just as drawing a map requires determining the destination first, when building a Q&A bot, you also need to clearly define the core goals of the task.\n",

        "Thus, your first objective is: Convert all user questions about internal personnel information into tool functions for database queries. Specifically, this includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Converting natural language questions provided by users into corresponding SQL query statements (such as NL2SQL, natural language to SQL).\n",
        "- Using the generated SQL query statement to access the database and retrieve corresponding query results.\n",
        "- Returning the query results as the output of the tool function to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Define tool functions\n",
        "Next, after configuring the environment variables, you can start building an agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, constructing an agent from scratch involves handling complex low-level implementations, which often require significant time and effort. Therefore, you can use the assistant API to help you build the agent more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assistant API is an interface that simplifies the creation process of intelligent applications. It provides rich functionalities, including support for multiple foundational models, flexible tool invocation, dialog management, and high scalability.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the previous section, you learned about the design philosophy and implementation methods of the multi-agent system.

        "- The core concept of the agent system\n",
        "- The construction principles and implementation methods of multi-agent systems\n",
        "- Multi-agent orchestration of LLM platforms\n",
        "\n",
        "### Further reading\n",
        "You have already learned how to use multi-agent systems to handle complex tasks, but this design is not limited to basic operations. In fact, properly designing a multi-agent system can help automate more complex business processes, improving efficiency and accuracy, and even handling tedious operations that usually require human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Effect demonstration and flowchart analysis\n",
        "Below is an actual application case of an agent system. Suppose you need to perform content validation on a webpage—not just checking static content, but also interacting with page elements. At this point, the advantages of a multi-agent system become apparent. Through division of labor and cooperation, multiple agents can efficiently complete tasks together without requiring manual intervention at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "<a href=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN016ARIqE22dYBpchyt2_!!6000000007143-2-tps-3456-1616.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n",
        "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN016ARIqE22dYBpchyt2_!!6000000007143-2-tps-3456-1616.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"1000\">\n",
        "</a>\n",
        "\n",
        "When facing a task that requires parsing HTML pages and performing specific actions, the division of labor among multiple agents is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Planner Agent: Decomposes tasks, such as identifying lists or buttons within HTML elements.\n",
        "- Selector Agent: Responsible for specific operational tasks, such as selecting specific elements and executing click actions.\n",
        "- Monitor Agent: Monitors task execution in real time to ensure the process completes as planned, such as verifying whether the correct button was clicked.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Integration of visual annotations in agent applications\n",
        "In practical projects, especially those involving webpage content interaction, relying solely on traditional text analysis capabilities often cannot accurately identify interface elements, leading to decreased execution efficiency and accuracy of agents. To address this issue, visual annotations are applied to automated testing and element recognition in console interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some scenarios, when agents operate console interfaces, due to the complexity of interface elements, models may struggle to accurately identify targets. By introducing visual annotation technology, the model's understanding and operation accuracy of interface elements can be improved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like when you use software, you may need to visually identify buttons, drop-down menus, or forms to make the correct operation. Without clear visual identifiers, you might select the wrong location or perform incorrect actions. Similarly, accurate identification of interface elements is crucial for agents during task execution. Through visual annotations, the system can \"tag\" these elements, helping agents \"see\" them more accurately and execute operations correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when performing automated testing on HTML pages, by using visual annotations, the system can label buttons, links, or forms on the page and guide agents to precisely select and operate these elements. This visually enhanced design significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex interfaces, making multi-agent systems more flexible and efficient when dealing with various UI elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Flexibility and technical integration of multi-agent systems\n",
        "Through this case, you can see that the design of multi-agent systems is not limited to a specific type of technology or scenario. Although visual annotations were combined with multi-agent systems in this example, the flexibility of multi-agent systems enables them to integrate with various technologies to meet different needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you can combine machine learning technology to optimize the decision-making process of agents, or use image processing technology to enhance the recognition capability of interface elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you can integrate multi-agent systems with natural language processing so that they can understand and generate more complex language instructions, applicable in intelligent customer service or text analysis scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can  choose the architecture and technical combination of multi-agent systems based on your requirements, custom-tailoring an automation solution for your use case.\n",
        "A multi-agent system is not only a tool but also a way of thinking, capable of flexibly designing and adjusting according to different tasks and scenarios, thereby delivering significant value across various applications. In future applications, whether facing automated webpage testing or handling more complex business processes, a well-designed multi-agent system can help improve efficiency, optimize operations, and even replace some human work, increasing productivity."
