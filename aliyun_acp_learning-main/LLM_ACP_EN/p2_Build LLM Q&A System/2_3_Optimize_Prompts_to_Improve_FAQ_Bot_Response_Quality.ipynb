            "\n",
            "## Materials Needed\n",
            "- **Beads**: Assorted sizes and colors\n",
            "- **Jump rings**: Small metal rings for attaching components\n",
            "- **Key ring**: To attach the keychain to keys\n",
            "- **Wire**: Thin, flexible wire for stringing beads\n",
            "- **Pliers**: Round-nose and flat-nose pliers for manipulating wire and jump rings\n",
            "- **Scissors**: For cutting wire\n",
            "- **Clasp** (optional): For adding a secure closure\n",
            "\n",
            "## Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 1: Gather Your Materials\n",

            "\n",
            "### Step 2: Cut the Wire\n",
            "Using your scissors, cut a piece of wire that is about 6 inches long. This length should be sufficient for most keychains, but you can adjust it based on the number of beads you plan to use.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 3: String the Beads\n",
            "Thread your chosen beads onto the wire. You can mix and match colors and sizes to create a unique design. If you want a symmetrical look, plan your bead pattern before starting.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 4: Secure the Beads\n",
            "Once you have strung all the beads, use your pliers to create a loop at one end of the wire. This will prevent the beads from falling off. To do this:\n",
            "1. Bend the wire at a 90-degree angle about 1/4 inch from the end.\n",
            "2. Wrap the wire around the base of the bend several times to form a secure loop.\n",
            "3. Trim any excess wire with your scissors.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 5: Attach the Jump Ring\n",
            "Open a jump ring using your pliers. Slide the looped end of your beaded wire through the jump ring, then close the jump ring securely. This will connect your beaded section to the key ring.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 6: Add the Key Ring\n",
            "Attach the key ring to the jump ring. Make sure it is securely closed to prevent the keychain from coming apart.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 7: Optional Clasp\n",
            "If you want to add a clasp for extra security, open another jump ring and attach it to the opposite end of your beaded wire. Then, attach the clasp to this jump ring and close it securely.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Step 8: Final Touches\n",
            "Inspect your keychain to ensure all connections are secure. Adjust any beads or loops if necessary. Once you are satisfied, your handmade keychain is ready to use!\n",
            "\n",
            "## Tips and Variations\n",
            "- **Personalize It**: Add charms or pendants that reflect the recipient's interests.\n",
            "- **Experiment with Colors**: Try different color combinations to create a variety of styles.\n",
            "- **Use Different Materials**: Consider using leather, fabric, or metal components for a different look.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Conclusion\n",
            "Creating a handmade keychain is a rewarding project that can be tailored to suit any style. Follow these steps to make a beautiful and functional keychain that you can be proud of. Happy crafting!"

        "Through  this section, you have gained a solid understanding of prompting techniques for both general LLMs and reasoning LLMs. The flexible application of these techniques ensures a baseline level of quality in AI-generated responses. However, as AI technology continues to evolve, these methods may also change—such as when reasoning models no longer require chain-of-thought prompting to achieve optimal performance.What’s most important to understand is that the core purpose of prompt engineering remains the same: to clearly express your core needs and provide rich, relevant background information (context). This is essential for effectively leveraging LLMs and ensuring they deliver accurate, meaningful results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In real-world LLM applications, domain experts often play a key role in designing prompts. Therefore, hardcoding prompts directly into your code should be avoided. Instead, consider making prompts configurable or even building an entirely configurable application workflow. This allows domain experts—especially those without technical backgrounds—to actively participate in refining prompts and shaping the overall process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alibaba Cloud's Model Studio offers a powerful application building capability, enabling users to write prompts and visually design complex application flows directly on the platform. This makes it an ideal tool for LLM projects that involve collaboration with non-technical domain experts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, you will learn about automated evaluation methods to assess the performance of Q&A bots. You’ll explore how to use quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness of your prompts and continuously improve your AI-driven applications."
